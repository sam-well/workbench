# Workbench
A front-end workspace for utility and readability

## Quick-Start

The only requirement is having [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/sam-well/workbench`
1. `cd` into the repo and `npm install`
1. Run `gulp`, which activates:
      - the development server,
      - a browser window with live reloading, and
      - build watches that update and compile your templates
1. Create files: (default files are added for quick-starts)
      - Pug templates in `src/templates`,
      - JavaScript files in `src/js`, and
      - Sass/SCSS files in `src/sass`
1. Files update in the browser as you save, and your templates (.pug, .js, and
   .sass/scss) compile to a single, minified file each. Default output directory
   is `builds/development`
